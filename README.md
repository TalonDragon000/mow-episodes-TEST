## Welcome to my Test Repo! 
This repo is to see if I can follow along and modify Dan Nolan's MOW tutorial for the SHAPE x ALCHEMY Hackathon starting in November. 
I've been wanting to get a working MMORPG going for a while now and this is THE opportunity for me to get a browser game up and running! 
I'm excited to get started, get used to GITHUB and its features, and not only learn how to deploy my own RPG, but also integrate it with WEB3 capabilities! 
Follow along with me if you like. :)
